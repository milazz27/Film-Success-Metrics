# Project Overview

After listening to the recent NYT podcast interview with the screenwriter behind the newest *Frankenstein* movie, I began wondering about this trend of movie remakes. On its face, it seems like a safe bet: if a movie's or book's plot was already loved by viewers in its first iteration, its a natural jump to conclude it will be successful once again. While it is nice to enjoy the nostalgia of the revistied plot, are we not pushing hard enough for original projects? I am curious about exploring what metrics seem to drive a film's success. I will start by examining remake-style films and film series before exploring what else could serve as a safe indicator of success.

I am aiming to answer the **following questions**:

- How safe a bet is a remake approach for a film's success
- Is there a certain number of time (or time between) remakes that better increase chances of success? 
- Are audience and critic reviews a good indicator of movie gross earnings?
- How can years be clustered to best identify trends?
- How do star actors and directors influence engagement and success?
- How important are genre's to trends?
